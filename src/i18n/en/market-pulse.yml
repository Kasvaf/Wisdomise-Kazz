    description: >-
      A bullish divergence occurs when the RSI displays an oversold reading
      followed by a higher low that appears with lower lows in the price. This
      may indicate rising bullish momentum, and a break above oversold territory
      could be used to trigger a new long position. Conversely, a bearish
      divergence occurs when the RSI creates an overbought reading followed by a
      lower high that appears with higher highs on the price. This may indicate
      rising bearish momentum, and a break below overbought territory could be
      used to trigger a new short position.
