**“Wealth” Service Providing Agreement**

This “Wealth” Service Providing Agreement (hereinafter “Wealth Agreement”) contains provisions governing together with the Terms and Conditions and the Cryptocurrency Risk Disclosure the contractual relationship between Service Provider and the Client if the Client uses the product “Wealth”.

## 1. Subject

*1.1* The Client mandates the Service Provider to manage the cryptocurrencies deposited in his existing or in a new wallet to be created with a third party crypto exchange platform (hereinafter the "Portfolio"). The Service Provider performs the services under this Wealth Agreement by means of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and, in principle, without human intervention (hereinafter the “Wealth Services” or “Wealth”). Furthermore, the software helps to allocate the cryptocurrencies held in the wallet with a third party crypto exchange platform across a portfolio of crypto coins and track the cryptocurrencies over time. For the use of the Wealth Services, the Service Provider offers to open an account (hereinafter the “Account”).

*1.2* If the Client selects the option to create a new wallet during the Account opening process, the Client agrees that the wallet will be opened with a third party crypto exchange provider. The Client agrees that the new wallet is not provided by the Service Provider, but by a third party.

*1.3* Based on the information provided by the Client when opening an Account, the Service Provider creates a risk profile (“Client’s Risk Profile”). The Client’s Risk Profile is taken into account in the provision of the Wealth Services under this Wealth Agreement.

*1.4* Before offering the Wealth Services, the Service Provider has carried out all usual initial checks and self-checks regarding the AI (including but not limited to regression testing, unit tests, integration tests, stress tests and user acceptance tests).

*1.5* The Service Provider monitors the correct functioning of the AI on a regular basis by means of a monitoring dashboard.

*1.6* If the Service Provider identifies a malfunction of the AI or another risk related to the AI, it shall take all necessary actions to remedy this malfunction and/or risk.

*1.7* The Service Provider offers neither trade execution services nor custody services for cryptocurrencies under this Wealth Agreement.

## 2. Authorization

*2.1* In order to perform the Wealth Services, the Service Provider is authorized to act in the name of, for the account of and at the risk of the Client at the Service Provider’s own discretion within the framework of the provisions set out in this Wealth Agreement, including any future amendments. Additionally, the Service Provider is authorized to act in its own name and for the account of and at the risk of the Client at the Service Provider’s own discretion within the framework of the provisions set out in this Wealth Agreement, including any future amendments.

*2.2* In particular, but not exclusively, the Service Provider is authorized to make and execute, in the name of, for the account of and at the risk of the Client, as well as in its own name, but for the account of and at the risk of the Client, purchase and/or sell decisions regarding the Client’s Portfolio.

## 3. Investment objective and other information provided by the Client

*3.1* The Client confirms that the information provided when opening his Account, in particular with regard to the creation of the Client’s Risk Profile, is correct at the date of the first use of the Wealth Services. This includes, in particular, the Client's knowledge and investment experience, the Client’s trading patterns and the Client's risk appetite.

*3.2* In addition, the Client confirms and acknowledges that, under normal circumstances, he does not need any cryptocurrencies deposited in the Portfolio to support himself and/or his dependents.

*3.3* The Client undertakes to notify the Service Provider immediately of any changes to the information provided by him via his Account. The changes communicated by the Client via his Account shall replace, for the purposes of this Wealth Agreement, the information previously provided by the Client.

## 4. Investment Strategy Parameters

*4.1* The investment strategy implemented by the AI is based on the Client's Risk Profile, which is created on the basis of the Client's knowledge and investment experience, the Client's trading patterns and the Client’s risk appetite.

*4.2* The Client must specify a maximum risk level for the Portfolio. The Client is provided with the definitions of the risk levels during the process of opening an Account.

Generally, the Client may choose between the following risk profiles: low risk low return (“LRLR”), medium risk medium return (“MRMR”) and high risk high return (“HRHR”). The higher the maximum risk level set by the Client, the greater the profit expectations usually are, but the higher the risk of loss.

The determination of a maximum risk level does not mean that the potential losses of the Portfolio are limited. However, the Service Provider sets limits, such as a “stop loss”, which does not limit the potential loss to a fixed level, but dynamically sets the stop loss levels based on the Client’s entry point.

If the maximum risk level determined by the Client is exceeded, the composition of the Portfolio will be adjusted to bring the risk of the Portfolio back to a level below the maximum risk level determined by the Client. The maximum risk level determined by the Client may therefore be temporarily exceeded until the composition of the Portfolio has been adjusted.

*4.3* In carrying out this Wealth Agreement and within the limits set by the Client through the Client’s Risk Profile, the Service Provider reserves the right to limit the risk of the Portfolio to a level that the Service Provider considers appropriate in accordance with this Wealth Agreement. The Service Provider is not obliged to maintain the portfolio risk at the highest level accepted by the Client, nor at a level just below it. In the event of the death of the Client and in the absence of instructions from his heirs or their representative, the Service Provider is entitled to limit the level of risk of the Portfolio.

*4.4* The Service Provider only provides Wealth Services regarding the cryptocurrencies mentioned in Annex I (hereinafter the “Cryptocurrencies”) including any future amendments.

*4.5* The Service Provider reserves the right to, but is not obliged to, extend the Wealth Services to other cryptocurrencies. In the event that the Service Provider extends its Wealth Services to other cryptocurrencies, it shall amend Annex I accordingly. The Service Provider shall inform the Client of amendments to Annex I by email and by publishing the information on its website.

*4.6* The Service Provider changes the composition of the Portfolio at regular intervals in line with market developments ("Reallocations"). The Service Provider takes into account various circumstances (e.g. frequent intervals, market events) when performing Reallocations. Which circumstances are taken into account and how frequently Reallocations are made depends on the Client’s Risk Profile. A Reallocation will also be made if the maximum risk level determined by the Client is reached or exceeded. The more frequently Reallocations are made, the better the Client&aps;s investment objective can be pursued. However, as Reallocations may incur transaction costs, frequent Reallocations may increase the costs borne by the Client. The Reallocation frequency does not determine the exact time of the next Reallocation. In particular, for technical reasons or to protect the interests of its Clients, the Service Provider may carry out the Reallocation a few days earlier or later than the date determined by the Reallocation frequency.

## 5. Instructions and Preferences of the Client

*5.1* The Client may communicate preferences to the Service Provider regarding the execution of the Wealth Services under this Wealth Agreement. During the provision of the Wealth Services, the Client may only change these preferences by changing the Client’s Risk Profile. However, the change in the Client’s Risk Profile shall have no effect on the execution of decisions already taken at the time of the receipt of the change notice by the Service Provider.

## 6. Communication channel

*6.1* The Client may communicate with the Service Provider only via his Account (all other communication channels are excluded) for the execution of this Wealth Agreement.

## 7. Investment Policy

*7.1* The Service Provider provides the Wealth Services under this Wealth Agreement using artificial intelligence, which enables it to make sale and/or purchase decisions on the Cryptocurrencies held in the Client’s Portfolio based on the Client's Risk Profile. The artificial intelligence used by the Service Provider consists of two main modules, a smart portfolio optimizer and an artificial intelligence core.

The Service Provider may define one or more strategies concerning the sale and purchase of the Cryptocurrencies, either for the entirety of clients, for specific client groups or only for certain clients.

The Service Provider uses quantitative (e.g., price changes) and other factors influencing the price of Cryptocurrencies for carrying out the Wealth Services.

Consequently, it does not carry out any qualitative analysis of the Cryptocurrencies, does not take note of any analysis that third parties may carry out on the Cryptocurrencies (but reserves the right to use the results of third parties&aps; analysis of the Cryptocurrencies in a quantitative manner) and does not follow the latest news on the Cryptocurrencies. The Service Provider refrains from making any subjective assessment of the development of the Cryptocurrencies.

*7.2* The AI check on a regular basis, in accordance with the frequency of Reallocation, whether the Portfolio risk is in line with the Client’s Risk Profile.

*7.3* TheService Provider shall ensure that the Client’s Portfolio is diversified in accordance with the Client&aps;s Risk Profile.

*7.4* The Service Provider does not take into account, even at the Client's request, any tax implications that the Wealth Services provided under this Wealth Agreement may have on the Client's situation.
