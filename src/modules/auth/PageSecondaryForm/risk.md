This Cryptocurrency Risk Disclosure provides a description of certain risks associated with the Services and Cryptocurrencies. However, it DOES NOT DISCLOSE OR EXPLAIN ALL THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THE INVESTMENT IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND/OR THE USE OF THE SERVICES. There may be additional risks that are not foreseen or mentioned in the Service Providing Agreement or in this Cryptocurrencies Risk Disclosure.
THE SERVICE PROVIDER STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE CLIENT SEEKS PROFESSIONAL ADVICE BEFORE DECIDING TO USE THE SOFTWARE.

## 1. Incorporation by reference

_1.1._ All risk disclosures and similar disclaimers set out in the Terms and Conditions and/or the Service Providing Agreement are incorporated herein by reference.

_1.2._ Capitalized terms used in this Cryptocurrency Risk Disclosure and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Service Providing Agreement and in the Terms and Conditions.

_1.3._ For ease of reading, the masculine form refers to any gender.

## 2. Risk profile of Cryptocurrencies

_2.1._ Various financial and nonfinancial rights, claims and/or assets, including rights and obligations not usually found in (traditional) financial markets instruments, e.g., equity and fixed income securities, may be granted by Cryptocurrencies. Clients intending to purchase Cryptocurrencies must carefully review the rights and obligations granted by the Cryptocurrencies before making any decisions.

_2.2._ Cryptocurrencies usually serve as means of payment. Therefore, the fair value of Cryptocurrencies may be very difficult to assess and may ultimately turn out to be much lower than expected.

_2.3._ The value of the Cryptocurrencies is primarily derived from the rights embodied therein. As the Client may not be able to exercise these rights, the Client may potentially derive very little benefits from the Cryptocurrencies as long as the Client holds such Cryptocurrencies through a centralized exchange. In particular, the Client may not be able to take advantage of opportunities, e.g. to redeem the Cryptocurrencies and/or to pay for products and/or services offered by the Issuer or third parties.

_2.4._ Furthermore, the technical functionalities of Cryptocurrencies (e.g., the possibility to transfer them, to create new Cryptocurrencies, the number of decimals up to which a Cryptocurrency may be traded, etc.) depend, inter alia, on the distributed ledger technology on which the cryptocurrency is based. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. The Client should review and ensure that he understands how the relevant Cryptocurrency and blockchain works before using the Services of the Service Provider.

_2.5._ There is no guarantee that the distributed ledger network on which the Cryptocurrency is based, are bug- free and will function in accordance with the Clients’ expectations.

## 3. Legal and regulatory uncertainty; Bankruptcy treatment

_3.1._ Cryptocurrencies have only existed for a few years and various regulatory bodies in Switzerland and worldwide have formed or are in the process of forming an opinion on necessary legal or regulatory measures in relation to Cryptocurrencies (e.g., regulation regarding money laundering, taxation, consumer protection, publicity requirements or capital controls, as well as the civil law characterization of Cryptocurrencies). Any forthcoming legal or regulatory measures may result in the illegality of Cryptocurrencies or the imposition of controls on the sale and/or purchase of Cryptocurrencies in (and thus illiquidity of) some or all of the Cryptocurrencies. In addition, control mechanisms may significantly increase transaction costs of Cryptocurrencies. By using the Services, the Client bears the risk of uncertainty regarding to the legal, regulatory and tax treatment of Cryptocurrencies.

## 4. Valuation issues; volatility; no or limited liquidity

_4.1._ The value of Cryptocurrencies may change significantly (even within a day) and the price movements of the Cryptocurrencies may be unpredictable.

_4.2._ While the volatility of the value of Cryptocurrencies is (perceived as) high, changes and advances in technology, fraud, theft and cyberattacks and regulatory changes, among others, may further increase volatility– and thus the potential for investment gains and losses. Additionally, Cryptocurrencies do not have the historical track record of other currencies or commodities, like gold, which could provide insight in whether current volatility levels are typical or atypical.

_4.3._ Investments in Cryptocurrencies are considered highly speculative Cryptocurrencies are subject to high volatility, i.e. the price of Cryptocurrencies may fall as well as rise rapidly on any given day. The movements of Cryptocurrencies are unpredictable. The Client acknowledges that Cryptocurrencies are not supervised by authorities or institutions such as central banks and that, therefore, there is no authority or institution that can intervene to stabilize the value of Cryptocurrencies and/or prevent or mitigate irrational price movements. There is a risk of significant or total loss when purchasing or selling Cryptocurrencies. The Client acknowledges and agrees that he accesses and uses the Services at his own risk.

_4.4._ Investments in Cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to irrational bubbles or loss of confidence, that could cause demand to collapse relative to supply, e.g. due to unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative Cryptocurrencies, or a spiral of deflation or inflation. Trust might also collapse due to technical problems, for example if significant amounts of Cryptocurrencies are lost or stolen or if hackers or governments are able to prevent transactions from being settled.

_4.5._ The market for the relevant Cryptocurrencies may experience periods of lower liquidity or even periods of illiquidity. The prices for the purchase or sale Cryptocurrencies are determined by the centralized exchange the Client trades its Cryptocurrencies. The Service Provider has no influence on the pricing of Cryptocurrencies. In addition, lower liquidity may lead to very fast and hectic price movements, wider spreads and/or in higher rejection rates. The Client’s ability to buy or sell Cryptocurrencies and compare the Cryptocurrency prices may consequently be limited.

## 5. Technology risks

_5.1._ The functioning of the Cryptocurrencies is based on the distributed ledger technology, which is still at an early stage and best practices have yet to be established and implemented. It is likely that the distributed ledger technology changes significantly in the future. Technological advances in code breaking, cryptography or quantum computing etc. may pose a risk to the security of Cryptocurrencies. In addition, alternative technologies to certain cryptocurrencies could be established, causing the Cryptocurrencies to lose significance or become obsolete. If the Cryptocurrencies are traded on a distributed ledger that becomes less relevant or obsolete, this could have a negative impact on the price and the liquidity of the Cryptocurrencies.

_5.2._ The functioning of Cryptocurrencies is based on open-source software. The Service Provider does not employ or control the developers of such opensource software. Developers may introduce vulnerabilities and/or programming errors into the open-source software or may cease development of the open-source software (especially at a critical time, when a security update might be necessary). This could leave Cryptocurrencies exposed to vulnerabilities, programming errors and risks of fraud, theft and cyber-attacks.

_5.3._ In recent years, the number of transactions in distributed ledger networks has increased sharply. An increasing number of transactions combined with the inability to make changes to distributed ledger technology may result in a slower processing time of transactions and/or a significant increase in the transaction fees. This may result in an increase in the fees and costs.

_5.4._ As there is no central body (like a government authority or a central bank) overseeing the development of distributed ledger technology, the functioning of distributed ledger systems, and further improvements to that functioning (e.g. ability to increase the number of transactions, reduce processing time, lower transaction fees, introduce security updates), depend on the cooperation and consent of stakeholders, among others, developers improving the open-source software related to Cryptocurrencies or so called "miners" who facilitate the processing of transactions. Disagreements among these stakeholders can result in a hard fork. Hard forks may lead to the instability of a particular version of a relevant distributed ledger system. In addition, hard forks or the threat of a potential hard fork may prevent the establishment of Cryptocurrencies as a realizable alternative to traditional asset trading. Hard forks or the possibility of a hard fork may lead to an increase of the fees.

_5.5._ Due to Cryptocurrencies’ special characteristics (like transactions are usually non-reversible and are carried out largely anonymously; Cryptocurrencies exist only virtually on a computer network) Cryptocurrencies are an attractive target for fraud, theft and cyber-attacks. Various techniques have been developed (or vulnerabilities identified) to steal Cryptocurrencies or disrupt the underlying distributed ledger technology, including e.g. the "51% attack" where attackers take control over a relevant distributed ledger network by providing 51% of the computer power in the relevant distributed ledger network, or the "denial of service attack" where attackers try to make the distributed ledger network's resources unavailable by overwhelming it with service requests. The Client is directly exposed to fraud, theft and cyber-attacks as high profile losses resulting of such events may increase skepticism about the long-term future of Cryptocurrencies and may prevent the establishment of Cryptocurrencies as an accepted means of representing currencies, as well as increasing the volatility and illiquidity of the Cryptocurrencies.

_5.6._ Cryptocurrencies have no physical equivalent as they only exist virtually on a computer network. Establishing a value for Cryptocurrencies is difficult as the value depends on the expectation and confidence that Cryptocurrencies can be used for payment transactions in the future and/or as a medium of exchange. Among others, continued high volatility, changes and advances in technology, fraud, theft and cyber-attacks and regulatory changes may prevent Cryptocurrencies from establishing themselves as an accepted medium of exchange potentially rendering Cryptocurrencies worthless.

## 6. Privacy; Public nature of Distributed Ledgers

_6.1._ The Client should be aware that any transfer, sale and purchase of Cryptocurrencies may be recorded in a public distributed ledger and may therefore be visible to the public.

_6.2._ Distributed ledgers on which Cryptocurrencies are issued and/or recorded is neither the property of, nor under any control of the Service Provider. Information available on the distributed ledgers may be processed, exploited or misused by third parties, including in unforeseen ways.
