        Disclosure the contractual relationship between Wisdomise (Switzerland)
        AG, Neuhofstrasse 5A, 6304 Baar, Switzerland (hereinafter the &quot;
        <strong>Service Provider</strong>&quot;) and the signatory (hereinafter
        the &ldquo;<strong>Client</strong>&rdquo;).&nbsp;For ease of reading,

          <ol>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1.The Client mandates the Service Provider to
              manage the cryptocurrencies deposited in his wallet with a third
              party crypto exchange platform (hereinafter the &quot;
              <strong>Portfolio</strong>&quot;). The Service Provider performs
              the services under this Agreement by means of artificial
              intelligence (&ldquo;<strong>AI</strong>&rdquo;) and, in
              principle, without human intervention (hereinafter the &ldquo;
              <strong>Services</strong>&rdquo;). Furthermore, the software helps
              to allocate the cryptocurrencies held in the wallet with a third
              party crypto exchange platform across a portfolio of crypto coins
              and track the cryptocurrencies over time. For the use of the
              Services, the Service Provider offers to open an account
              (hereinafter the &ldquo;<strong>Account</strong>&rdquo;).
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.2.During a set-up phase until 31 August 2023
              (hereinafter the &ldquo;<strong>Set-up Period</strong>&rdquo;),
              the Service Provider reserves the right to perform the actions
              required for the provision of the Services set out in Section 1.1
              of this Agreement only partially and not completely, in
              particular, but not exclusively, to give signals to buy and/or
              sell cryptocurrencies but not to make and execute any buy and/or
              sell decisions. The Client acknowledges and accepts that he has no
              claim against the Service Provider for the full provision of the
              Services during the Set-up Period. The Service Provider shall
              inform the Client by email and by publishing the information on
              its website as soon as additional actions are available for the
              provision of the Services set out in Section 1.1 of this
              Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.3.Based on the information provided by the Client
              when opening an Account, the Service Provider creates a risk
              profile (&ldquo;<strong>Client&rsquo;s Risk Profile</strong>
              &rdquo;). The Client&rsquo;s Risk Profile is taken into account in
              the provision of the Services under this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.4.Before offering the Services, the Service
              Provider has carried out all usual initial checks and self-checks
              regarding the AI (including but not limited to regression testing,
              unit tests, integration tests, stress tests and user acceptance
              tests).
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.5.The Service Provider monitors the correct
              functioning of the AI on a regular basis by means of a monitoring
              dashboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.6.If the Service Provider identifies a malfunction
              of the AI or another risk related to the AI, it shall take all
              necessary actions to remedy this malfunction and/or risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.7.The Service Provider offers neither trade
              execution services nor custody services for cryptocurrencies under
              this Agreement.

              &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1.In order to perform the Services, the Service
              Provider is authorized to act in the name of, for the account of
              and at the risk of the Client at the Service Provider&rsquo;s own
              discretion within the framework of the provisions set out in this

          <ol>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1.The Client confirms that the information
              provided when opening his Account, in particular with regard to
              the creation of the Client&rsquo;s Risk Profile, is correct at the
              date of signing this Agreement. This includes, in particular, the
              Client&apos;s knowledge and investment experience, the
              Client&rsquo;s trading patterns and the Client&apos;s risk
              appetite.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.In addition, the Client confirms and
              acknowledges that, under normal circumstances, he does not need
              any cryptocurrencies deposited in the Portfolio to support himself
              and/or his dependents.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3.The Client undertakes to notify the Service
              Provider immediately of any changes to the information provided by
              him via his Account. The changes communicated by the Client via
              his Account shall replace, for the purposes of this Agreement, the
              information previously provided by the Client.
            </li>

          <strong>Investment Strategy Parameters</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1.The investment strategy implemented by the AI is
              based on the Client&apos;s Risk Profile, which is created on the
              basis of the Client&apos;s knowledge and investment experience,
              the Client&rsquo;s trading patterns and the Client&rsquo;s risk
              appetite.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2.The Client must specify a maximum risk level for
              the Portfolio. The Client is provided with the definitions of the
              risk levels during the process of opening an Account.&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Generally, the Client may choose between the following risk profiles:
        low risk low return (&ldquo;LRLR&rdquo;), medium risk medium return
        (&ldquo;MRMR&rdquo;) and high risk high return (&ldquo;HRHR&rdquo;). The
        higher the maximum risk level set by the Client, the greater the profit
        expectations usually are, but the higher the risk of loss.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The determination of a maximum risk level does not mean that the
        potential losses of the Portfolio are limited. However, the Service
        Provider sets limits, such as a &ldquo;stop loss&rdquo;, which does not
        limit the potential loss to a fixed level, but dynamically sets the stop
        loss levels based on the Client&rsquo;s entry point.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the maximum risk level determined by the Client is exceeded, the
        composition of the Portfolio will be adjusted to bring the risk of the
        Portfolio back to a level below the maximum risk level determined by the
        Client. The maximum risk level determined by the Client may therefore be
        temporarily exceeded until the composition of the Portfolio has been
        adjusted.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3.In carrying out this Agreement and within the
            limits set by the Client through the Client&rsquo;s Risk Profile,
            the Service Provider reserves the right to limit the risk of the
            Portfolio to a level that the Service Provider considers appropriate
            in accordance with this Agreement. The Service Provider is not
            obliged to maintain the portfolio risk at the highest level accepted
            by the Client, nor at a level just below it. In the event of the
            death of the Client and in the absence of instructions from his
            heirs or their representative, the Service Provider is entitled to
            limit the level of risk of the Portfolio.
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.4.The Service Provider only provides Services
            regarding the cryptocurrencies mentioned in Annex I (hereinafter the
            &ldquo;<strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong>&rdquo;) including any
            future amendments.
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.5.The Service Provider reserves the right to, but is
            not obliged to, extend the Services to other cryptocurrencies. In
            the event that the Service Provider extends its Services to other
            cryptocurrencies, it shall amend Annex I accordingly. The Service
            Provider shall inform the Client of amendments to Annex I by email
            and by publishing the information on its website.
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.6.The Service Provider changes the composition of
            the Portfolio at regular intervals in line with market developments
            (&quot;<strong>Reallocations</strong>&quot;). The Service Provider
            takes into account various circumstances (e.g. frequent intervals,
            market events) when performing Reallocations. Which circumstances
            are taken into account and how frequently Reallocations are made
            depends on the Client&rsquo;s Risk Profile. A Reallocation will also
            be made if the maximum risk level determined by the Client is
            reached or exceeded. The more frequently Reallocations are made, the
            better the Client&apos;s investment objective can be pursued.
            However, as Reallocations may incur transaction costs, frequent
            Reallocations may increase the costs borne by the Client. The
            Reallocation frequency does not determine the exact time of the next
            Reallocation. In particular, for technical reasons or to protect the
            interests of its Clients, the Service Provider may carry out the
            Reallocation a few days earlier or later than the date determined by
            the Reallocation frequency.

              &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.1.The Client may communicate preferences to the
              Service Provider regarding the execution of the Services under
              this Agreement. During the provision of the Services, the Client
              may only change these preferences by changing the Client&rsquo;s
              Risk Profile. However, the change in the Client&rsquo;s Risk
              Profile shall have no effect on the execution of decisions already
              taken at the time of the receipt of the change notice by the
              Service Provider.

              are excluded) for the execution of this Agreement.

              &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.1.The Service Provider provides the Services under
              this Agreement using artificial intelligence, which enables it to
              make sale and/or purchase decisions on the Cryptocurrencies held
              in the Client&rsquo;s Portfolio based on the Client&apos;s Risk
              Profile. The artificial intelligence used by the Service Provider
              consists of two main modules, a smart portfolio optimizer and an
              artificial intelligence core.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Service Provider may define one or more strategies concerning the
        sale and purchase of the Cryptocurrencies, either for the entirety of
        clients, for specific client groups or only for certain clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service Provider uses quantitative (e.g., price changes) and other
        factors influencing the price of Cryptocurrencies for carrying out the
        Services. The Service Provider does not use qualitative methods like
        following the latest news and tweets on the Cryptocurrencies for
        carrying out the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, it does not carry out any qualitative analysis of the
        Cryptocurrencies, does not take note of any analysis that third parties
        may carry out on the Cryptocurrencies (but reserves the right to use the
        results of third parties&apos; analysis of the Cryptocurrencies in a
        quantitative manner) and does not follow the latest news on the
        Cryptocurrencies. The Service Provider refrains from making any
        subjective assessment of the development of the Cryptocurrencies.

            with the frequency of Reallocation, whether the Portfolio risk is in
            line with the Client&rsquo;s Risk Profile.

          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.3.The Service Provider shall ensure that the

          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.4.The Service Provider does not take into account,
            even at the Client&apos;s request, any tax implications that the
            Services provided under this Agreement may have on the Client&apos;s
            situation.

              of trades, but the trades are executed by the third party crypto

              the specific criteria for portfolio diversification.

              carry out the Services. However, the termination of this Agreement
              shall have no effect on the execution of decisions already taken

            <li>
              Various financial and nonfinancial rights, claims and/or assets,
              including rights and obligations not usually found in
              (traditional) financial markets instruments, e.g., equity and
              fixed income securities, may be granted by Cryptocurrencies.{" "}
              <strong>
                Clients intending to purchase Cryptocurrencies must carefully
                review the rights and obligations granted by the
                Cryptocurrencies before making any decisions.
              </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Cryptocurrencies usually serve as means of payment. Therefore, the
              fair value of Cryptocurrencies may be very difficult to assess and
              may ultimately turn out to be much lower than expected.
            </li>
            <li>
              The value of the Cryptocurrencies is primarily derived from the
              rights embodied therein. As the Client may not be able to exercise
              these rights, the Client may potentially derive very little
              benefits from the Cryptocurrencies as long as the Client holds
              such Cryptocurrencies through a centralized exchange. In
              particular, the Client may not be able to take advantage of
              opportunities, e.g. to redeem the Cryptocurrencies and/or to pay
              for products and/or services offered by the Issuer or third
              parties.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Furthermore, the technical functionalities of Cryptocurrencies
              (e.g., the possibility to transfer them, to create new
              Cryptocurrencies, the number of decimals up to which a
              Cryptocurrency may be traded, etc.) depend, inter alia, on the
              distributed ledger technology on which the cryptocurrency is
              based. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of
              transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire
              network of computer systems on the blockchain. The Client should
              review and ensure that he understands how the relevant
              Cryptocurrency and blockchain works before using the Services of
              the Service Provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no guarantee that the distributed ledger network on which
              the Cryptocurrency is based, are bug- free and will function in
              accordance with the Clients&rsquo; expectations.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Cryptocurrencies have only existed for a few years and various
              regulatory bodies in Switzerland and worldwide have formed or are
              in the process of forming an opinion on necessary legal or
              regulatory measures in relation to Cryptocurrencies (e.g.,
              regulation regarding money laundering, taxation, consumer
              protection, publicity requirements or capital controls, as well as
              the civil law characterization of Cryptocurrencies). Any
              forthcoming legal or regulatory measures may result in the
              illegality of Cryptocurrencies or the imposition of controls on
              the sale and/or purchase of Cryptocurrencies in (and thus
              illiquidity of) some or all of the Cryptocurrencies. In addition,
              control mechanisms may significantly increase transaction costs of
              Cryptocurrencies.{" "}
              <strong>
                By using the Services, the Client bears the risk of uncertainty
                regarding to the legal, regulatory and tax treatment of
                Cryptocurrencies.

            <li>
              The value of Cryptocurrencies may change significantly (even
              within a day) and the price movements of the Cryptocurrencies may
              be unpredictable.
            </li>
            <li>
              While the volatility of the value of Cryptocurrencies is
              (perceived as) high, changes and advances in technology, fraud,
              theft and cyberattacks and regulatory changes, among others, may
              further increase volatility&ndash; and thus the potential for
              investment gains and losses. Additionally, Cryptocurrencies do not
              have the historical track record of other currencies or
              commodities, like gold, which could provide insight in whether
              current volatility levels are typical or atypical.

              Investments in Cryptocurrencies are considered{" "}
              <strong>highly speculative&nbsp;</strong>investments.
              Cryptocurrencies are subject to <strong>high volatility</strong>,
              i.e. the price of Cryptocurrencies may fall as well as rise
              rapidly on any given day. The movements of Cryptocurrencies are
              unpredictable. The Client acknowledges that Cryptocurrencies are
              not supervised by authorities or institutions such as central
              banks and that, therefore, there is no authority or institution
              that can intervene to stabilize the value of Cryptocurrencies
              and/or prevent or mitigate irrational price movements.{" "}
              <strong>
                There is a risk of significant or total loss when purchasing or
                selling Cryptocurrencies. The Client acknowledges and agrees
                that he accesses and uses the Services at his own risk.&nbsp;

            <li>
              Investments in Cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to irrational
              bubbles or loss of confidence, that could cause demand to collapse
              relative to supply, e.g. due to unexpected changes imposed by the
              software developers or others, a government crackdown, the
              creation of superior competing alternative Cryptocurrencies, or a
              spiral of deflation or inflation. Trust might also collapse due to
              technical problems, for example if significant amounts of
              Cryptocurrencies are lost or stolen or if hackers or governments
              are able to prevent transactions from being settled.&nbsp;

              <strong>
                The market for the relevant Cryptocurrencies may experience
                periods of lower liquidity or even periods of illiquidity.&nbsp;
              </strong>
              The prices for the purchase or sale Cryptocurrencies are
              determined by the centralized exchange the Client trades its
              Cryptocurrencies. The Service Provider has no influence on the
              pricing of Cryptocurrencies. In addition, lower liquidity may lead
              to very fast and hectic price movements, wider spreads and/or in
              higher rejection rates. The Client&rsquo;s ability to buy or sell
              Cryptocurrencies and compare the Cryptocurrency prices may
              consequently be limited.

          <strong>Technology risks</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.1.The functioning of the Cryptocurrencies is based
              on the distributed ledger technology, which is still at an early
              stage and best practices have yet to be established and
              implemented. It is likely that the distributed ledger technology
              changes significantly in the future. Technological advances in
              code breaking, cryptography or quantum computing etc. may pose a
              risk to the security of Cryptocurrencies. In addition, alternative
              technologies to certain cryptocurrencies could be established,
              causing the Cryptocurrencies to lose significance or become
              obsolete. If the Cryptocurrencies are traded on a distributed
              ledger that becomes less relevant or obsolete, this could have a
              negative impact on the price and the liquidity of the
              Cryptocurrencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.2.The functioning of Cryptocurrencies is based on
              open-source software. The Service Provider does not employ or
              control the developers of such opensource software. Developers may
              introduce vulnerabilities and/or programming errors into the
              open-source software or may cease development of the open-source
              software (especially at a critical time, when a security update
              might be necessary). This could leave Cryptocurrencies exposed to
              vulnerabilities, programming errors and risks of fraud, theft and
              cyber-attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.3.In recent years, the number of transactions in
              distributed ledger networks has increased sharply. An increasing
              number of transactions combined with the inability to make changes
              to distributed ledger technology may result in a slower processing
              time of transactions and/or a significant increase in the
              transaction fees. This may result in an increase in the fees and
              costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.4.As there is no central body (like a government
              authority or a central bank) overseeing the development of
              distributed ledger technology, the functioning of distributed
              ledger systems, and further improvements to that functioning (e.g.
              ability to increase the number of transactions, reduce processing
              time, lower transaction fees, introduce security updates), depend
              on the cooperation and consent of stakeholders, among others,
              developers improving the open-source software related to
              Cryptocurrencies or so called &quot;miners&quot; who facilitate
              the processing of transactions. Disagreements among these
              stakeholders can result in a hard fork. Hard forks may lead to the
              instability of a particular version of a relevant distributed
              ledger system. In addition, hard forks or the threat of a
              potential hard fork may prevent the establishment of
              Cryptocurrencies as a realizable alternative to traditional asset
              trading. Hard forks or the possibility of a hard fork may lead to
              an increase of the fees.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.5.Due to Cryptocurrencies&rsquo; special
              characteristics (like transactions are usually non-reversible and
              are carried out largely anonymously; Cryptocurrencies exist only
              virtually on a computer network) Cryptocurrencies are an
              attractive target for fraud, theft and cyber-attacks. Various
              techniques have been developed (or vulnerabilities identified) to
              steal Cryptocurrencies or disrupt the underlying distributed
              ledger technology, including e.g. the &quot;51% attack&quot; where
              attackers take control over a relevant distributed ledger network
              by providing 51% of the computer power in the relevant distributed
              ledger network, or the &quot;denial of service attack&quot; where
              attackers try to make the distributed ledger network&apos;s
              resources unavailable by overwhelming it with service requests.
              The Client is directly exposed to fraud, theft and cyber-attacks
              as high profile losses resulting of such events may increase
              skepticism about the long-term future of Cryptocurrencies and may
              prevent the establishment of Cryptocurrencies as an accepted means
              of representing currencies, as well as increasing the volatility
              and illiquidity of the Cryptocurrencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.6.Cryptocurrencies have no physical equivalent as
              they only exist virtually on a computer network. Establishing a
              value for Cryptocurrencies is difficult as the value depends on
              the expectation and confidence that Cryptocurrencies can be used
              for payment transactions in the future and/or as a medium of
              exchange. Among others, continued high volatility, changes and
              advances in technology, fraud, theft and cyber-attacks and
              regulatory changes may prevent Cryptocurrencies from establishing
              themselves as an accepted medium of exchange potentially rendering
              Cryptocurrencies worthless.

          <ol>
            <li>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.1.The Client should be aware that any transfer,
              sale and purchase of Cryptocurrencies may be recorded in a public
              distributed ledger and may therefore be visible to the
              public.&nbsp;

          The Client has taken note of and undertakes to comply with all laws,

          The Client confirms that he is in compliance with all tax rules and

            All notices or communications (hereinafter the &ldquo;
            <strong>Notices</strong>&rdquo;) from the Service Provider to the
            Client will normally be made in electronic form, in particular by
            sending an email or providing an in-app notice. The Service Provider
            may issue any Notice, at its sole discretion, via any other means of
            communication. The Client expressly agrees to receive correspondence
            in electronic format and is aware of, and accepts, any consequences,
            losses and risks that might result from the electronic transmission
            of information.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Client shall ensure that he or any person authorized by him can
            be contacted by the Service Provider at all times by email.
          </li>
          <li>
            All Notices from the Service Provider to the Client shall be deemed
            as having been duly issued to the Client when sent to the email
            address most recently supplied by the Client or when made available
            in the Account or on the Service Provider&rsquo;s website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notices from the Service Provider posted, sent or given, where
            relevant, in the Account or on the Service Provider&rsquo;s website
            or via email shall be deemed as having been duly received as soon as
            they are posted, sent or given. The Client shall be responsible for
            regularly consulting his Account and the Service Provider&rsquo;s
            website in order to take note of any Notices from the Service
            Provider.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Client is solely responsible for all communications issued with
            his passwords (hereinafter the &ldquo;
            <strong>Identification</strong> <strong>Codes</strong>&rdquo;) as
            well as for all sales and purchases carried out with his
            Identification Codes. Any person using the Client&rsquo;s
            Identification Codes or identifying himself over the Internet (as
            defined below) by using the correct Identification Codes shall be
            considered by the Service Provider as authorized to act on behalf of
            the Client, notwithstanding the absence of a power of attorney in
            favor of this person. The Service Provider shall not be liable for
            any Damages suffered by the Client as a result of communications,
            sale and purchases carried out as a result of using the
            Client&rsquo;s Identification Codes even in cases where such have
            been used fraudulently, illegally and/or against the wishes of the
            Client.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Client shall take any and all measures necessary in order to
            protect his Identification Codes and to ensure that unauthorized
            third parties do not have access to his Account. The Service
            Provider strongly recommends to the Client that he regularly change
            his passwords. If the Client stores his Identification Codes or any
            other confidential information in an accessible manner on his
            computer or anywhere else, he does so at his own risk. The Client
            shall immediately inform the Service Provider if he suspects his
            Identification Codes to be known by an unauthorized third party and
            if the access to his Account needs to be blocked. The Client shall
            bear any and all consequences linked directly or indirectly to the
            blocking and unblocking of his Account. For the avoidance of doubt,
            the Service Provider can only block the access to the Client&rsquo;s
            Account, but not to the account on the third party exchange. If the
            account on the third party exchange needs also to be blocked, it is
            the Client&rsquo;s responsibility to take all necessary steps with
            the third party exchange.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Client acknowledges that it might be impossible to rescind,
            withdraw or amend the Client&rsquo;s Risk Profile with immediate
            effect, even if a corresponding sale respective purchase is not yet
            executed at the time of the Client&rsquo;s request to do so. The
            Client acknowledges that he is solely liable for any Damages
            resulting from any rescinding, withdrawal or amendment of the
            Client&rsquo;s Risk Profile requested during the execution of a sale
            respective purchase in accordance with the previous Client&rsquo;s
            Risk Profile.

            &rdquo;). The Service Provider reserves the right at its sole
            discretion to conduct technical maintenance, during which time,
            access to the Service Provider&rsquo;s website may not be possible
            and it may also not be possible to carry out Services.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            The Client shall be liable for any Damages in connection with his

            The Client is aware of the risks inherent in using the Service
            Provider&rsquo;s website or otherwise in using the Internet,
            including the risk of using open, generally public networks for what
            regards the transmission of data from the Client to the Service
            Provider and from the Service Provider to the Client. He is also
            aware that data are regularly transmitted in an unsupervised manner
            beyond Switzerland&rsquo;s borders, even if the sender and the
            recipient are both located in Switzerland. Even where the data
            themselves are encrypted, the sender and recipient can sometimes
            remain unencrypted, such that third parties may be able to infer
            their identity.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            The Service Provider expressly disclaims any liability for any
            Damages incurred by the Client in connection with transmission
            errors and failures (including delays in the transmission of
            Instructions, misunderstandings, duplications, etc.), breakdowns
            (e.g. caused by any maintenance), slowdowns, overloads, transmission
            cutouts, technical defects, service interruptions (e.g. systems
            maintenance), disruptions, interference, illegal attacks (e.g.
            hacking) and willful blockage of telecommunication devices and
            networks (e.g. &ldquo;mail bombing&rdquo;, denial of service) or in
            connection with other malfunctions, errors or deficiencies on the
            part of telecommunication and network operators, exchanges,
            settlement or clearing systems, other financial service providers or
            the Client (including Client&rsquo;s hardware and software).&nbsp;

          <li>
            The Service Provider accepts no liability and gives no guarantee
            that data transmitted and published via the Internet are correct,
            accurate and complete. In particular, account related data (e.g.
            current value of the portfolio, executed purchase and/or sale
            decisions) and information in the public domain shall not be
            binding. The Client is particularly aware of the following Internet
            specific risks for which the Service Provider cannot accept
            liability:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          Inadequate knowledge of the system and defective security measures can
          facilitate unauthorized access. The Client is aware of the risk that
          his Account may be infiltrated by computer viruses and other harmful
          programs that infected the Client&rsquo;s hardware or software (e.g.
          via the Internet, e-mails or the exchange of data carriers) or may be
          misused by an unauthorized third party. The hardware and software used
          by the Client should always be from a trustworthy source The Client
          shall be responsible for informing himself of the necessary security
          measures (e.g. anti-virus programs, firewalls) and for taking such
          measures;
        </li>
        <li>
          The compilation of user statistics by internet providers, from which
          it may be deduced that the Client has contacted the Service Provider;
        </li>
        <li>
          The use of the Client&rsquo;s hardware and software by persons other
          than the Client brings additional risks. If the Client uses and stores
          any information (notably his password, user ID, portfolio information,
          account statements, etc.) on an accessible manner on his hardware, he
          does so at his own risk and is fully responsible for all consequences.
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Client acknowledges that certain software components, such as
              coding algorithms, artificial intelligence, the sale and purchase
              of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrencies may be subject to (in
              particular import and export) restrictions in certain countries.
              The Client must inform himself accordingly and shall assume sole
              liability for risks in this regard. The Service Provider accepts
              no liability for the infringement of provisions governing the
              import, export and use of prohibited software components or
              provisions governing the holding or the sale and/or purchase of
              cryptocurrencies.

            <li>
              The Client accepts and consents that the Service Provider collects
              and processes personal data. The type of personal data processed
              by the Service Provider and how the Service Provider processes
              such personal data is set out in the Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy.
              Pursuant to the Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy, the Client
              acknowledges that the Service Provider is entitled to process the
              Client&rsquo;s personal data for different purposes, in particular
              for the purposes of carrying out Services and other operations,
              providing any Service under the Agreement, fulfilling legal
              requirements, maintaining the Client relationship, marketing its
              products and Services, and improving the quality of products and
              Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Client consents and explicitly authorizes that the Service
              Provider exchanges information on the Client (including personal
              data) with subsidiaries of the Service Provider, as well as with
              third party intermediaries and service providers abroad, including
              in jurisdictions that do not offer a level of protection of
              personal data equivalent to that of Switzerland. This consent and
              authorization shall also be considered to have been given to the
              relevant subsidiary of the Service Provider, third party
              intermediary or service provider which shall also be authorized to
              process such information on the client, in accordance with
              applicable laws.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Client acknowledges and agrees that once Personal Data has
              been transferred outside of Switzerland, it is generally no longer
              protected by Swiss law but subject to the applicable legislation,
              and may be transmitted to third parties or authorities in
              accordance with any applicable law.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Client is aware of the fact that any data transmitted via the
              Internet are regularly transmitted in an unsupervised manner
              beyond Switzerland, even if the sender and the recipient are both
              located in Switzerland. Even where the data themselves are
              encrypted, the sender and recipient can sometimes remain
              unencrypted, such that third parties may be able to infer their
              identity.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Client also acknowledges that the Service Provider may use a
              third party supplier&rsquo;s software and that the IP address of
              the computer or device on which the Client uses the said software
              may become known to that third party supplier, who may not be
              located in Switzerland. The Client accepts any and all related
              consequences, particularly in terms of confidentiality and data
              protection.

          <strong>MONEY LAUNDERING</strong>

              The Client confirms that he is aware of the requirements imposed
              by anti-money laundering legislation and regulations and that he
              is obliged to co-operate fully with the Service Provider in order
              to comply with all applicable requirements. Any other obligations
              arising out of and in connection with legal and regulatory
              anti-money laundering measures under any applicable laws remain
              reserved.&nbsp;

            <li>
              The Client is obliged, and undertakes, to provide the Service

              concerning his person or, wherever necessary, concerning the
              identity of any third party on whose behalf and for whose account
              he acts, notably in a capacity as agent.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Service Provider may in particular request information and
              supplementary details in respect of the justification for, and
              economic background of, the Client, the assets on the Account, and
              any sale and purchase and other operations associated with his
              Account. If such information is not provided or is, in the opinion
              of the Service Provider, insufficient, it may, without prior
              Notice to the Client, decline to provide Services to the Client,
              postpone the provision of Services, notify the relevant
              authorities and/or terminate the relationship with the Client.
              Provided that the Service Provider has complied with applicable
              legal provisions or internal or external rules and regulations,
              the Service Provider shall not be liable for any Damages caused by
              any or all of these measures.

              under the responsibility and supervision of the Service Provider
              to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations. Where
              personal data of the Client is involved, the Service Provider will

              accordingly. Save where otherwise advised by the Service Provider
              in its Notice, such amendments shall be deemed as having been

              amendments have been published or if they are not contested in

              Should any provision of the Agreement or any part thereof be
              illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any manner whatsoever
              pursuant to the legislation of any given jurisdiction, this shall
              not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the

              provision by a legal, valid and enforceable solution that comes as
              close as possible to the purpose of the affected provision. If a
              provision of the Agreement or any part thereof becomes illegal,
              invalid or unenforceable because of a law, Market Rule or other
